# Quick start
To get this project up and running on your local machine, you need to have docker installed. If you are on a Windows OS, you need to have wsl2 installed and enabled in your docker settings.
Once that is settled, download and unpack the project files. Then, in your terminal: 
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
You should have your images and container running after some minutes. In your postman, you can test the endpoints!
